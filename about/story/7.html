          <p style="margin-left: 10"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">In Syracuse, 
          NY in the fall of 1993, I held a very precious, beautiful baby
          girl in my arms.&nbsp; I cuddled her, kissed her tiny forehead and 
          held her in<span lang="en-us"> </span>my arms as long as I could.&nbsp; My 
          precious, beautiful niece, Lily....&nbsp; I<span lang="en-us"> </span>loved 
          her from the minute I saw her, I have loved her ever since and I will<span lang="en-us">
          </span>love her forever.</font></p>
          <p style="margin-left: 10"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">Soon, she and 
          her parents, Paul and Suh, moved back to Taiwan. A beautiful<span lang="en-us">
          </span>sister, Joyce, was born next in Taiwan.&nbsp; Pictures were sent to 
          America of<span lang="en-us"> </span>two lovely, healthy girls as they 
          grew.&nbsp; Aunt Ellen sent matching dresses<span lang="en-us"> </span>to 
          them and other fun things, as they grew<span lang="en-us">.</span></font></p>
          <p style="margin-left: 10"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">Paul and Suh 
          told them to work diligently on learning their English so they<span lang="en-us">
          </span>could travel to America to visit Aunt Ellen.&nbsp; Aunt Ellen, Alena 
          and Beau<span lang="en-us"> </span>are so excited that someday they 
          will come visit!</font></p>
          <p style="margin-left: 10"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">Then one 
          horrible day the news reaches us that Lily is very ill.&nbsp; We pray<span lang="en-us">
          </span>and pray for her recovery.&nbsp; We search the internet for good 
          doctors and new<span lang="en-us"> </span>treatments to help cure our 
          Lily.&nbsp; Lily takes all the medicines and the<span lang="en-us"> </span>
          treatments.&nbsp; She valiantly fights the cancer.&nbsp; The doctors try their 
          best<span lang="en-us"> </span>to help cure her.&nbsp; She seems to be 
          making progress but then the cancer<span lang="en-us"> </span>comes 
          back.</font></p>
          <p style="margin-left: 10"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">We, her family 
          in America, think if Lily isn't strong enough to travel to<br>
          America to visit Aunt Ellen, then Aunt Ellen better travel to Taiwan 
          to<br>
          visit Lily.<br>
          <br>
          So in October, 2001, Beau and Ellen fly into Taipei Airport.&nbsp; Joyce 
          and<br>
          Paul are waiting for us when we arrive.&nbsp; On the plane, in the seat 
          next to<br>
          me was a Taiwan-born cancer researcher, Dr. David Wu, from America.&nbsp; 
          He
          understands Lily's illness and vows to find someone to help Lily.<br>
          <br>
          The following Sunday, David Wu brings and an alternative medicine 
          therapy
          doctor to the hospital to see Lily and look at her charts.&nbsp; New hope 
          for
          our Lily!<br>
          <br>
          After a few more days in the hospital, Lily has recovered enough to 
          come<span lang="en-us"> </span>home from the hospital.&nbsp; The next day 
          is her birthday.&nbsp; Lily, Beau, Suh,<span lang="en-us"> </span>Grandmama 
          and I travel up to northern Taiwan to see the beautiful land.<span lang="en-us">
          </span>Lily climbs mountains with us!&nbsp; We play on the shore together 
          at Yehliu.<span lang="en-us"> </span>Later Suh buys fresh seafood at 
          the shore for Lily's birthday dinner.&nbsp;Very<span lang="en-us"> </span>
          soon it is time for Ellen and Beau to return to America.&nbsp; The two 
          weeks<span lang="en-us"> </span>have ended already.<br>
          <br>
          Lily gets up early, has her new birthday purse all packed to take with 
          her<span lang="en-us"> </span>to see us off at the airport.&nbsp; Lily is 
          so brave, so good and so smart!&nbsp;We<span lang="en-us"> </span>love her 
          so much!</font></p>
          <p style="margin-left: 10"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">Back in 
          America we keep updated on her condition.&nbsp; At one point in time,<span lang="en-us">
          </span>the abdominal tumor has shrunk somewhat.&nbsp; We are cautiously 
          optimistic. Lily is bravely fighting the cancer.</font></p>
          <p style="margin-left: 10"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">Unfortunately, 
          the next news we hear is not good.&nbsp; Soon it seems Lily is<span lang="en-us">
          </span>desperately ill , struggling to live so she can grow up.&nbsp; She 
          does not give<span lang="en-us"> </span>up.&nbsp; We, her family, do not 
          give up.&nbsp; We hope and pray for miracles<span lang="en-us"> </span>
          continuously.&nbsp; But alas, ultimately, the cancer is too strong.&nbsp; We are<span lang="en-us">
          </span>still hoping and praying for a miracle but then we find out 
          Lily's struggle<span lang="en-us"> </span>has ended.</font></p>
          <p style="margin-left: 10"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">God has 
          reached down to earth, gently lifted our precious Lily up to heaven<span lang="en-us">
          </span>and gathered her in His loving arms.&nbsp; My father and my husband, 
          Paul, know<span lang="en-us"> </span>that she is coming and are there 
          to welcome her into their loving arms too.</font></p>
          <p style="margin-left: 10"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">Now she is 
          strong and healthy and happy, climbing mountains, gathering<span lang="en-us">
          </span>beautiful flowers, and putting together jigsaw puzzles in 
          Heaven.&nbsp;My<span lang="en-us"> </span>father and my Paul are with her 
          now and will watch over her for all of<span lang="en-us"> </span>
          eternity.&nbsp; We have a united family in Heaven and when our day comes to 
          join<span lang="en-us"> </span>them, it will be a glorious day indeed!</font></p>
          <p style="margin-left: 10"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">Lily is now a 
          beautiful, blissfully happy Angel in Heaven , surrounded by<span lang="en-us">
          </span>loving family members.</font></p>
          <p style="margin-left: 10"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">Her life on 
          earth was shortened by cancer because God wanted her beautiful<span lang="en-us">
          </span>presence in Heaven sooner.&nbsp; She is now bathed in Light, 
          Comfort, and Peace<span lang="en-us"> </span>with her loving Heaven 
          family.&nbsp; We, her earth family, will miss her<span lang="en-us"> </span>
          presence in our lives, but we are happy to know she is safe and at 
          peace in<span lang="en-us"> </span>Heaven.</font></p>
